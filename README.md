# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction
# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning and Flask API

## Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) based on patient data, with the goal of enhancing early detection and intervention. The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset, explores various machine learning algorithms, and provides a user-friendly interface for prediction. 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains 70,000 patient records with 12 features, including age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and physical activity levels. 

## Methodology
The project follows a structured methodology, including:

* **Data acquisition and exploration:** Gathering the dataset and performing exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and detect outliers. 
* **Data preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the data for model training, including handling missing values, scaling features, and removing outliers. 
* **Model selection and training:** Evaluating various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest, to identify the most suitable model for prediction. 
* **Model evaluation and comparison:** Assessing the performance of the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
* **Prediction and visualization:** Developing a user interface using the Flask API to allow users to input their data and receive predictions on their likelihood of developing CVD. 

## Results
The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy of 72.56% in predicting cardiovascular disease. The project also provides insights into the importance of various features in predicting CVD risk. 

## Tools and Technologies
The project utilizes the following tools and technologies:

* Python 
* Jupyter Notebook 
* Pandas 
* NumPy 
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Flask API

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting cardiovascular disease and assisting in early detection and intervention. The developed model can be a valuable tool for healthcare professionals and individuals to assess CVD risk and take proactive measures for better heart health. 

## Future Scope
Future work can focus on improving the model's accuracy by incorporating more complex techniques and additional features. The project can also be extended to develop user-friendly applications for Android and iOS platforms to facilitate wider accessibility and early diagnosis of CVD.
